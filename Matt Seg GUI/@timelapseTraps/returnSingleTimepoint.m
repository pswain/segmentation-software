function timepointIm=returnSingleTimepoint(cTimelapse,timepoint,channel,type)
% timepointIm=returnSingleTimepoint(cTimelapse,timepoint,channel,type)
%
% Most basically returns the image for a given channel and timepoint. Does
% so in raw format, so is usually a uint16.
%
% timepoint   :   number indicating the desired timepoint (will access this
%                 element of the cTimepoint array).
% channel     :   number (default 1) indicating which of the channels in
%                 cTimelapse.channelNames to use to identify appropriate
%                 files.
% type        :   string (default 'max'). if more than one file is loaded
%                 (e.g. in the case of a z stack) how to handle this stack.
%                 either 'max','sum','min' or 'stack' - applying
%                 concomitant operation to the stack or returning the whole
%                 stack in the case of 'stack'.
%
% This is a rather confusing fuction that does a number of things, but due
% to its widespread use in the code is hard to change. a timepoint and
% channel are specified, and the channel index is used to get a channel
% string from the cTimelapse.channelNames field. all filenames associated
% with that timepoint (i.e. in cTimepoint.filename cell array) that contain
% the channel string are identified. If there is only one this is loaded,
% whereas if there are more than one they are all loaded and put into a
% stack. This stack is then treated accoding to the 'type' argument, with
% either a projection ('min','max' etc.) being made or the whole stack
% being returned. The default is max.
% A number of operations are then applied to the image.
%
% scaling - if the imScale field of cTimelapse is not empty the image is
%           rescaled using the imresize command imresize(image, imScale)
%
% background correction - if the field cTimelapse.BackgroundCorrection{channel}
%                         is not empty it is taken to be a flat field
%                         correction and is appplied to the image by
%                         element wise multiplication.
%
% rotation - if cTimelapse.image_rotation is not zero the image is rotated
%            by this amount using imrotate function. Any extra elements
%            added are padded with the median value of the image. This may
%            change the size of the image.
%
% offset - if the channel row of the array cTimelapse.offset is not zero
%          then the image is shifted by this amount (offset is specified as
%          [x_offset y_offset]). Allows images from different channels to
%          be registered properly. Any extra values are padded by the
%          median value of the image.
%
% These corrections are applied in this order.
%
% The function also takes a number of other liberties. If the timelapseDir
% is set to 'ignore' it takes the filenames to be absolute (this can be
% done using the method makeFileNamesAbsolute). If this is not the case, it
% constructs the file name from timelapseDir and filename{i}. In doing so
% it takes the liberty of resaving the file name with only the relative
% path (i.e. it throws away anything behind the last / or \).
%
% before loading the existence if the putative file is checked, and if it
% doesn't exist the user is asked to specify a new file location. This is
% done using a special GUI that rechecks whether the file has been found
% every 5 seconds, this is done in case the disk was just temporarily
% disconnected. For cExperiments this is best done using the
% changeRootDirsAll method.This is not done if the timelapseDir is 'ignore'
% and filenames are absolute.
%
% If there is no filename matching the channel at the timepoint requested
% an image of the appropriate size of all zeros is returned and a warning
% displayed.
