segmentation-software
=====================

This is public version of the cell segmentation software developed (and being developed) by the swain lab. The project is written mostly in matlab and its purpose is to segment microscopy images of cells (i.e. distinguish pixels that are cells from other cells or background) especially in the case of timelapses where other features (such as traps) are present. 

There is documentation for using the software in the Documentation folder.

For help using the software please contact the swain lab, Edinburgh:
